# Wordabulary
Play with words , because why not ?

This repository deals with letters, word, vocabulary, to rekindle the love for reading.There may be many alternatives for this .How is this any different ? I aim to create a module which works offline ,because it doesn't make sense to me to have an online module if I could just Google it.

## Usage

The pip module is not fully developed yet ..till then we have this.

* Most frequent characters / words in a document

## TODO : 

* The plain words.txt file is pretty huge(~12mb) , so a workaround I am using right now is save it as words_txt.py for now.
   (Current sie ~ 3mb).Need to sort this out.

* Implement actual dictionary , thesaurus in a not so obvious way.

* Add synonyms , antonyms. 

* Check rhymes based on stress points , not only pronunciation 

* Extend finding typos to suggesting corrections
